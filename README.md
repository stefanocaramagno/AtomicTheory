# Atomic Theory

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing a project on **atomic theory**. <br>
This project was completed as **Final Project** for my [Middle School Diploma](https://www.4istitutocosta.edu.it/indirizzo-di-studio/scuola-secondaria-di-i-grado/) at ["D. Costa" Middle School](https://www.4istitutocosta.edu.it/), in Augusta, Italy.

## üåç Context

This repository includes two main documents: a slide presentation and a written report. <br>
These materials were developed to provide a comprehensive overview of atomic energy and its applications, as well as fundamental principles in electromagnetic theory.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Understanding Atomic Structure and Energy**: Learn about the components of the atom and the principles behind atomic energy, including both nuclear fission and fusion.
- **Exploring Electromagnetic Principles**: Gain insights into how electromagnetic fields work and their applications in generating and utilizing electrical energy.
- **Historical and Scientific Context**: Understand the historical development and scientific discoveries related to atomic energy and electromagnetic theory.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Slide Presentation**: A visual presentation covering topics such as the structure of the atom, the principles of nuclear energy, and various interdisciplinary connections.
- **Written Report**: A detailed analysis that explores both atomic and electromagnetic principles in depth, including practical examples and their implications in modern science and technology.
- **Topics Covered**: Both the slide presentation and the written report include the following subjects:
  - **Science**: Detailed discussions on atomic structure, principles of nuclear energy (fission and fusion), and electromagnetic theory, including electric circuits and Ohm's law.
  - **Geography**: Examination of Japan's geographic relevance to nuclear energy, focusing on historical and environmental aspects.
  - **History**: Overview of the nuclear age, including the development and use of nuclear weapons during World War II.
  - **Literature**: Exploration of Italian hermetic poetry, focusing on Salvatore Quasimodo's reflections on war and human nature.
  - **Art**: Study of the Pointillism movement, its techniques, and how it represents a scientific approach to color and perception.
  - **Music**: Analysis of the origins and evolution of jazz music, its cultural significance, and its development in the United States.
  - **Physical Education**: Analysis of the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a propaganda tool used by the Nazi regime.
  - **Language Studies**:
    - **English**: Insights into American culture, major landmarks, and the significance of sports in society.
    - **French**: Description of France's involvement in World War II, including its resistance efforts.
